# 🚀 BridgeLabz-Training

This repository serves as a *learning workspace for my BridgeLabz Training, focused on building a strong foundation in **Git & GitHub, Core Java programming, and logical problem solving*.  
It documents my *day-wise learning progress*, hands-on practice, and structured code organization.



## 📂 Folder Structure

The repository is organized in a modular and clean way.  
Currently, all foundational Core Java work resides in the *core-java-practice* branch.
